Pre-requiset   
you should have firefox version 55 or higher  
(because i used new jar of selenium which required newer version and if i used old jar then browser was not starting.)  

for chrome also new version is prefered.

How to run:
1.) Run directly two test cases are there  
a.)  chromeBrowser_TC001.java select test case and run as testNG   
     src/test/java-->whatfix.wikipedia-->chromeBrowser_TC001.java   
     
b.)  firefox_TC002.java  select test case and run as testNG   
     src/test/java-->whatfix.wikipedia-->firefox_TC001.java        
     
2.) Go to Pom.xml
  right click--->runconfig-->maven build-->new namme-->select workspace -->give goal "clean test" --->apply-->run
